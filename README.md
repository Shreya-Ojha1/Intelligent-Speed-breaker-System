# Intelligent-Speed-breaker-System
An Arduino-based automated system designed to improve pedestrian safety at zebra crossings by detecting pedestrians and approaching vehicles. It raises a servo-controlled speed breaker and activates LED warnings when necessary, enforcing speed control without human intervention.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Arduino Uno & Nano
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- Servo Motor
- Red LED Indicators
- Breadboard, wires, power supply

⚙️ How It Works
1. **Pedestrian Detection** – Ultrasonic sensor detects if a person is on the crossing.
2. **Vehicle Monitoring** – Another sensor detects approaching vehicles and estimates proximity.
3. **LED Warning** – Lights turn on to alert drivers.
4. **Speed Breaker Activation** – If the vehicle doesn’t slow down, a servo motor raises a temporary speed breaker.

✅ Features
- Automatic speed breaker activation
- Real-time detection of pedestrians and vehicles
- LED-based alert system
- Cost-effective and energy-efficient
- Scalable for urban and rural road use

🔬 Testing Summary
- Detection accuracy: ~90%
- Response time: 1–2 seconds
- Successfully tested in a simulated road environment

🧩 Challenges
- Sensor noise and false triggers
- Servo delay issues
- Component synchronization
- Power supply stability

🔮 Future Improvements
